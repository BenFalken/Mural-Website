# Mural

This project was part of a fundraising effort during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to raise money for small businesses. 

Users would pay a small fee of one dollar to upload one of their own photos to a larger mosaic of images - doing so allowed them to also download a pdf of the mural.

Each transaction was verified manually but every other piece of this project was automated.
